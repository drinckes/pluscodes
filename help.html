  <h1>Stop <i>explaining</i> your address</h1>
  <p>
    Instead of giving people complicated directions, just give them a short
    code that tells them exactly where you want them to go. No problem, just
    get the code and give it to them! It won't cost you or them anything.
  </p>
  <p>
    Many people live in places where street addresses are inaccurate or
    don't exist. Even where there are addresses, they might not be commonly
    used, or they might be unknown to online maps or navigation devices.
  </p>
  <p>
    Google has developed a technology to give everywhere in the world a
    short code that exactly identifies a place, such as homes and
    businesses. The codes are free to get, free to use, and we've open
    sourced the software, so anyone can <a href=
    "https://github.com/google/open-location-code">get it</a> and add it to
    their website.
  </p>
  <h1>How do I get a code?</h1>
  <p>
    You don't need to apply, and there is no setup. The codes are completely
    free. Just tap the map on the place you want and the code will be shown
    at the bottom. If the red square is too big, tap on it again to get a
    more accurate code. If you want to keep it, you can just add it to your
    bookmarks.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can even find out the code for your friends or family and tell them
    what it is.
  </p>
  <h1>How do I tell someone else my code?</h1>
  <p>
    Just give them the code and tell them to come here to use it!
  </p>
  <p>
    The codes come in two forms - long and short, just like street addresses.
    Long codes, like <a href="/+8FMG.P9FW6M">+8FMG.P9FW6M</a>, are like an
    address that includes the city and country. This will work
    from anywhere in the world.
  </p>
  <p>
    The short version of the code (<b>+P9FW6M</b>) is like giving someone
    only the street name and number. It will work if they're in the right
    city, but just like a street name, if they're too far away there's a
    risk they'll go to a street with the right name but in the wrong town.
    For the short code to work, you need to be at most 50km away from the
    place. If you're further away than that, you need the full code, or to
    use the short code and a nearby city, like <b>+P9FW6M Pisa, Italy</b>.
  </p>
  <h1>Aren't people already doing something like this?</h1>
  <p>
    Creating short codes for places is something that lots of people have
    looked at in different ways. All of them have their advantages and
    disadvantages, but we felt that it was worth designing a new system
    that was free, open and easy to use.
  </p>
  <h1>About this website</h1>
  <p>
    Tapping the map or entering a code will change the URL. You can bookmark
    a place, give it a name, and use it just by opening the page. This will
    even work if you are offline, except that the map won't be able to load.
  </p>
  <p>
    For directions, you can tap on the directions icon and a list of map
    providers will be displayed. A simple compass mode, showing direction
    and distance, is also included so that you can get directions to a place
    without a network connection.
  </p>
  <p>
    Not all devices have compasses built in, and even some that do can't be
    accessed. The first time you use the compass it will check to see if it
    works.
  </p>
  <h1>More information</h1>
  <p>
    Yay! You made it to the bottom of the page! We'd love to get feedback -
    ideas on how the codes can be used, suggestions for improvements,
    anything.
  </p>
  <p>We have a <a href=
    "https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/open-location-code">discussion list</a>
    for questions and comments. Anyone can join!
  </p>
  <p>If you're interested in using these codes, or just looking at the software,
    it's available in our public <a href=
    "https://github.com/google/open-location-code">Github</a> repository.
  </p>
  <p>
    There is also a <a href=
    "https://github.com/google/open-location-code/blob/master/docs/olc_definition.adoc">
    document</a> that explains why we feel a new standard is
    necessary and provides the specification.
